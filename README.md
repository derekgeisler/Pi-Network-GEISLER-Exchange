This is a basic structure for a DeFi exchange. However, please note that a production-ready DeFi exchange would require:

Extensive security audits
More complex pricing mechanisms (e.g., automated market makers)
Integration with oracles for price feeds
Governance mechanisms
Yield farming and staking features
Comprehensive testing
User-friendly UI/UX
Compliance with relevant regulations

Additionally, you'll need to adapt this code to work specifically with the Pi Network blockchain, as the exact implementation details may differ from Ethereum-based systems.
Remember, building a DeFi exchange involves handling real financial assets, so it's crucial to prioritize security and seek expert advice before deploying anything to a live network. It's also important to thoroughly understand and comply with all relevant financial regulations in your jurisdiction.
